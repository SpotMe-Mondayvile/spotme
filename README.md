This project is not a completely original idea, but it will allow us engineers and developers to 
build something from the ground up. We will be able to collaborate and tune our skills as we add to
the tech-stack of the project.
## SpotMe Synopsis
The idea of this app is to allow people who go to the gym to find workout partners.
1. Geolocation pulls up Gyms in Proximity, user selects
2. The User can submit their routine for the day.
3. App finds a matching pair/workout buddy
4. User's can accept or decline matches like tinder

# Phases
## Phase 1: 

### Gym Selector -
- A list is presented to the user of gyms in a particular zip code that the user will provide.
### Routine Storing -
- For phase 1 the user will put what type of workout they're going for
  - push/pull
  - crossfitt
  - upper body
  - lower body
  - abs
  - etc.
### Matching Algorithm -
  - Looking to work out with?
    - Gender
      - Male, Female, Other
  - When are you working out?
    - User inputs time
  - User submits their routine/muscle group and/or push/pull workout
### Matching Acceptance -
- Two panel will be available, open matches that are posted, and match requests. 
- Users can see list of open matches, then requests to work out with them,
  - similar to linked in friend requests, (check | X)

## Phase 2:
### Gym Selector -
  - Using Google Location services, provides gyms that are in the area, then user selects the gym
### Routine Storing -
- Routine object will be a list of exercises
  - Each exercise will contain
    - WorkOut Name
    - Number of reps
    - Number of Sets
    - Weight if necessary
### Matching Algorithm -
  - Still with the list of available 
  - Hoping to get some python action in, some machine learning, and have the best matches at the top
### Matching Acceptance -
  - Will stay the same and phase 1. 


## Phase 3: 

### Gym Selector -
### Routine Storing -
### Matching Algorithm -
### Matching Acceptance -

## Phase 4: 

### Gym Selector -
### Routine Storing -
### Matching Algorithm -
### Matching Acceptance -
