This project is not a completely original idea, but it will allow us engineers and developers to 
build something from the ground up. We will be able to collaborate and tune our skills as we add to
the tech-stack of the project.
## SpotMe Synopsis

2. The User can submit their routine for the day.
3. App finds a matching pair/workout buddy
4. User's can accept or decline matches like tinder
